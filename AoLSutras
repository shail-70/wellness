We were given 5 Sutras/Rules to live life peacefully:

Accept the situation and people as they are. And take action.
Do not find intention in other people’s mistakes. Approach them (with the intention for a change in their behavior) only when you have a solution to offer for their own benefit and not for selfish reasons.
Do not be a football of other people’s opinion.
Live in the Present. Give your 100 percent to whatever you are doing. (This will save your own time, you will be content that you gave your best)
Opposite values are complimentary to each other. (Meaning, every kind of situation and experience matters equally in our lives. They are complimentary to each other. Otherwise, life would be boring.)
